Regex Tutorial

Created a gist for this assignment. Here is the link to the gist: https://gist.github.com/Shmeeheart/e61508c8435c94f9d7b0d5b916fa9bd6 

Unfortunately, I was making all of my changes in GitHub versus the gist, so I will need to include the github repository to prove that it is, indeed, created and researched by yours truly, Jennifer Goodwin (Shmeeheart).
